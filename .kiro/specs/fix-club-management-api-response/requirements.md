# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The ClubManagement component is experiencing a runtime error where `clubs?.map is not a function`. This occurs because the component expects the clubs data to be an array, but the API endpoint `/api/clubs` returns a standardized response format with the clubs array wrapped in a `data` property. The component needs to be updated to handle the standardized API response format correctly.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user accessing the Club Management page, I want the page to load without runtime errors so that I can view and manage clubs successfully.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the ClubManagement component fetches clubs data THEN the component SHALL handle the standardized API response format correctly
2. WHEN the API returns `{ success: true, data: [...clubs] }` THEN the component SHALL extract the clubs array from the `data` property
3. WHEN the clubs data is successfully extracted THEN the component SHALL render the clubs list without errors

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the ClubManagement component to be consistent with other components that consume standardized API responses so that the codebase maintains consistency.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the ClubManagement component processes API responses THEN it SHALL follow the same pattern as other components that consume standardized responses
2. WHEN handling API errors THEN the component SHALL properly handle both success and error response formats
3. WHEN the API response structure changes THEN the component SHALL be resilient to the standardized response format
