I need to create a comprehensive game preparation page for a netball team management application. The page should help coaches prepare for upcoming games by providing analysis, lineup recommendations, and strategic planning tools.

Please create a new page at `client/src/pages/GamePreparation.tsx` with the following structure:

1. Main Layout:
- Use the existing PageTemplate component
- Implement a tabbed interface with 4 main sections: Overview, Analysis, Lineup, and Strategy
- Include a header showing the next game details and opponent

2. Tab Structure:
```typescript
type Tab = 'overview' | 'analysis' | 'lineup' | 'strategy';

interface GamePreparationProps {
  gameId: number;
  teamId: number;
  clubId: number;
}
```

3. Required Components:
- Overview Tab:
  * Next game details
  * Team form statistics
  * Opponent analysis
  * Top recommended lineups

- Analysis Tab:
  * Historical performance against opponent
  * Quarter-by-quarter analysis
  * Position performance analysis
  * Player matchup analysis

- Lineup Tab:
  * Recommended lineups based on historical data
  * Custom lineup builder
  * Player availability management
  * Position assignment interface

- Strategy Tab:
  * Game plan creation
  * Key matchup identification
  * Tactical notes
  * Pre-game objectives

4. Data Requirements:
- Use existing API endpoints:
  * /api/games for game data
  * /api/teams for team data
  * /api/players for player data
  * /api/statistics for performance data

5. Integration Points:
- Use existing components:
  * TeamPositionAnalysis
  * PlayerPerformance
  * OpponentPreparation
  * CourtLayout

6. State Management:
- Use React Query for data fetching
- Implement local state for:
  * Selected tab
  * Current lineup
  * Player availability
  * Tactical notes

Please create the initial page structure and implement the Overview tab first. The page should be responsive and follow the existing design system.

Key features to implement:
1. Tab navigation
2. Data fetching and loading states
3. Error handling
4. Responsive layout
5. Integration with existing components

The page should be accessible at /game-preparation/:gameId
