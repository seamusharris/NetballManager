# API Endpoint Mapping and Restructuring Plan

Generated: August 1, 2025

## Overview

This document maps all current API endpoints in NeballManager and proposes a restructured API design that better reflects the domain relationships:

- **Games** are independent entities where teams compete
- **Players** can belong to multiple clubs  
- **Teams** belong to clubs
- **Stats** can be game-level (official) or team-game level (recorded by teams)

## Proposed New Structure

### Core Principles

1. **Resource Independence**: Games and players exist independently
2. **Clear Ownership**: Clubs own teams, teams participate in games
3. **Multiple Access Paths**: Same data accessible through different contexts
4. **Permission Context**: Use club/team context when auth matters

### Endpoint Patterns

```typescript
// Pattern 1: Global Resources
/api/v1/[resource]                                    // List/create
/api/v1/[resource]/:id                               // Get/update/delete

// Pattern 2: Club-Scoped Resources  
/api/v1/clubs/:clubId/[resource]                     // Club's resources
/api/v1/clubs/:clubId/[resource]/:id                 // Specific resource

// Pattern 3: Game-Related Resources
/api/v1/games/:gameId/[aspect]                       // Game aspects
/api/v1/games/:gameId/[aspect]/team/:teamId          // Team-specific

// Pattern 4: Team Views (for convenience)
/api/v1/teams/:teamId/games                          // Team's games
/api/v1/teams/:teamId/games/:gameId/[aspect]         // Team's view
```

GET    /api/v1/clubs/:clubId/users           // Club users
```

### Migration Strategy

#### Phase 1: Add New Endpoints (Parallel)
1. Keep all existing endpoints working
2. Add new `/api/v1/` endpoints alongside old ones
3. Update `apiClient` to prefer new endpoints

#### Phase 2: Update Frontend
1. Update all API calls to use new endpoints
2. Update React Query keys to match new structure
3. Test all functionality thoroughly

#### Phase 3: Deprecate Legacy
1. Mark old endpoints as deprecated
2. Add console warnings when old endpoints used
3. Plan removal date (e.g., 3 months)

#### Phase 4: Remove Legacy
1. Remove old endpoint handlers
2. Remove URL correction logic
3. Clean up route files

### Example Migrations

#### Example 1: Getting Team's Games

```typescript
// ‚ùå OLD: Ambiguous ownership
GET /api/teams/:teamId/games

// ‚úÖ NEW: Clear context
GET /api/v1/teams/:teamId/games
// Returns games where this team participates
```

#### Example 2: Recording Game Stats

```typescript
// ‚ùå OLD: Inconsistent patterns
POST /api/game/:gameId/team/:teamId/stats
POST /api/games/stats/batch

// ‚úÖ NEW: Consistent resource-based
POST /api/v1/games/:gameId/stats/team/:teamId
POST /api/v1/games/stats/batch
```

#### Example 3: Player Management

```typescript
// ‚ùå OLD: No club context
GET /api/players
POST /api/players

// ‚úÖ NEW: Club-scoped when needed
GET /api/v1/players                    // All players (with filters)
GET /api/v1/clubs/:clubId/players      // Club's players
POST /api/v1/clubs/:clubId/players     // Add to club
```

### Benefits of New Structure

1. **Clear Mental Model**
   - Games are competitions, not owned by teams
   - Players can belong to multiple clubs
   - Teams are always club-scoped

2. **Consistent Patterns**
   - Predictable URL structure
   - Clear resource ownership
   - Obvious permission boundaries

3. **Flexible Access**
   - Multiple paths to same data
   - Context-appropriate endpoints
   - Efficient batch operations

4. **Future-Proof**
   - Supports inter-club competitions
   - Allows player transfers/borrowing
   - Scales to multiple leagues/seasons

### Implementation Checklist

- [ ] Create `/api/v1/` route handlers
- [ ] Add new game-centric endpoints
- [ ] Add player-clubs relationship endpoints
- [ ] Update apiClient to use new routes
- [ ] Update React Query keys
- [ ] Add deprecation warnings to old endpoints
- [ ] Update documentation
- [ ] Plan legacy removal timeline
- [ ] Remove URL correction logic
- [ ] Clean up route files

### Notes

1. **Backward Compatibility**: Keep old endpoints during transition
2. **Gradual Migration**: Update one resource type at a time
3. **Testing**: Comprehensive tests for all new endpoints
4. **Documentation**: Update API docs as you go
5. **Monitoring**: Track usage of old vs new endpoints
